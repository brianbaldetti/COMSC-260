# COMSC-260
Code from DVC COMSC-260 class taken over the spring of 2023. I definitely learned a lot about how the indepth operations of a computer works during this class however I think I also learned how much I take high level languages for granted. It is nice to have a lot of control, yet it is much much slower. I really think this class did help with my conceptual understanding of computers as well as some discrete math concepts though so it is nice to see how they are somewhat interchangable.

# NOTICE
I have renamed all the programs here and have also changed the order around so that it would be as difficult as possible for someone to directly copy my code. In addtion, I have tried to remove all references to the direct class that I took as well.
